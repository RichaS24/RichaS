👋 Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

🧑‍💻 About Me:
I am a passionate and motivated data science enthusiast with a focus on eye disease classification and machine learning. My technical skills include proficiency in C, C++, and Python,
as well as expertise in using popular Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib. I have experience working with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, 
and basic MongoDB. My data science expertise lies in data visualization and implementing various machine learning algorithms.

📚 Education:

Post Graduation Diploma in Data Science from RTMNU, with an expected completion in 2023.
Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from SNDT University, Sadabai Raisoni Women’s College, Nagpur (2019-2022).

Secondary School from CBSE, Kendriya Vidyalaya Vayusena Nagar, Nagpur (2016-2017).

🚀 Projects:

Eye Disease Classification (PGD minor project):
I have been working on developing a mobile application for analyzing eye diseases. Using Python, Data Visualization, 
and CNN (machine learning) along with TensorFlow on the server, I aim to create a model that can analyze scan pictures (in jpg format) and 
provide users with information about eye-related problems and disorders through a simple interface. I have also explored data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.

🏆 Achievements and Volunteering:

I believe in giving back to the community and have actively volunteered in various initiatives:

Volunteer in Rotary Club of Nagpur, participating in events like Ryla camp and distributing paper bags for environmental awareness.
Worked with UNICEF for the World’s Largest Lesson event in Nagpur in August 2019.
Member of NSS (SRWC-UNIT) and spent time at an old age home, contributing to society.
Holder of the National Skill Development Certificate.
Proudly achieved a 5-star rating with a gold batch on HackerRank in Python.

💼 Professional Skills:
Apart from my technical skills, I possess essential professional skills like time management, teamwork, critical thinking, adaptability, detail orientation, and project management.
